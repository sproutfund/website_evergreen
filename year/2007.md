            description: "<em>In Service</em>, a project of Pittsburgh Filmmakers and Bricolage Theatre Company, is a multimedia performance and film project, combining live performance, projected video, and still images to recreate the first-hand experiences of men and women serving in the Iraq War as soldiers, government officials, and war correspondents. In a community theater setting at the downtown Harris Theatre, native Pittsburghers recount their personal war narratives, telling the stories of how world events shape our city and its people, and how our world is changed, too, by people here at home. Also part of the project, a gallery of photography is on display at the Melwood Screening Room, featuring the work of local photographers reflecting on the war, complementing stories with striking imagery and creating a complete, powerful, emotional experience."

            description: "One Cold Hand, a project by Jenn Gooch, connected the Pittsburgh community by focusing on one common, but unfortunate, event—the loss of a glove. Centered around the website Onecoldhand.com, the project magnified and explored the concept of loss, while also collecting and saving gloves lost throughout the city in the chance that they may be found again, creating a representative emblem of hope and community. Over the course of a winter, One Cold Hand collected 450 gloves and returned more than a dozen to their owners. The project was covered in over 145 media outlets worldwide through the Associated Press, including the New York Times and BBC Radio London, and locally in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Tribune Review, and on KDKA television news."

Led by Pittsburgh Region Clean Cities, Steel City Biofuels, Bike Pittsburgh, and Restorative Events, LLC., the festival directly engaged a variety of participant audiences including the Downtown workforce, Oakland’s student population, and shoppers and visitors in the Southside Works and nearby river walk area. A mix of fun and excitement, education and advocacy, and discussion and demonstration, the Alternative Transportation Festival presented the current trends and emerging innovations happening right now, in Pittsburgh to new audiences."
