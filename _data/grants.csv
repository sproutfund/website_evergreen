The people in the mural represent the people of Dormont today, as they go about everyday activities and enjoy the outdoors. Although Sprout rarely allows communities to display their name in murals, not wanting the pieces to be seen as welcome signage, Shields came up with a sly workaround.

Shiloh Street is home to restaurants, shops, and a beautiful city park, but visitors to Mt. Washington rarely tread past the overlook area on Grandview Avenue. Residents of Mt. Washington saw a Sprout mural as an opportunity to not only make a beautiful contribution to their community, but also entice visitors to discover its full potential by venturing onto Shiloh Street. With this intention in mind, artist Gerry Tonti created a design with a focus on the wall’s upper-right-hand corner—the portion of the building that can be seen from Grandview Avenue—to draw viewers further into the community. For the scene itself, community members wanted a visually pleasing design that would reflect the idyllic calm of an evening spent gazing at the city skyline.

Artist Monika McAndrew festively combines all of these elements in her Bloomfield mural by depicting a parade from the community’s past to present. The background consists of a true-to-life streetscape, complete with the area’s most iconic piece of architecture, the Bloomfield Bridge. George Washington and his men bring up the rear of the parade, harkening back to the area’s Revolutionary War era roots, when Washington provided its namesake by describing it as a “field of many blooms.” Next to take up the path are pairs of traditionally clothed German and Italian [or Polish?] immigrants, representing the waves of different ethnicities settling in the area. Finally, a present-day grandfather and granddaughter lead the parade and suggest the community’s multi-generational appeal today. The entire scene is framed by the outstretched hands of a romantic couple fit for classic Italian cinema, warmed by the glow of the sunset color palette chosen by McAndrew.

The tree represents a “tree of life,” as many generations grow up and go on to raise their own families in the community.

For the design itself, artist Ian Thomas was inspired by a trip he took to China. The community wanted a pastoral and peaceful scene that invited the viewer in, and Thomas drew from this experience to create the beautiful landscape of City Lung. The mural’s name comes from a phrase used in China meaning the focal point and energy choice of a city—and for these community members, the Strip District truly was Pittsburgh’s city lung.

Artist Jackie Kresak’s design of an unfinished quilt seemed perfectly suited to the neighborhood. Inspired by a quilt that her mother started but never had the chance to finish, the mural depicts Kresak’s hands picking up where her mother left off. Aptly symbolizing the Penn Main Corridor being bound together as a community, yet still being a work in progress, Kresak comments that “sewing a quilt is like bringing together the different kinds of people and uniting them into one whole blanket or community. The purple folded b lock with the pin in it represents that it, like a community, is still under construction and changing for the better.” The promise of the mural is that, like quilting, the growth of a community identity can take new directions and form new patterns out of the many pieces of itself.

The figures standing along the bottom edge of the mural correspond to the community members that Laurie interviewed, and the design is her rendition of how they described their vision. The windows they look through frame a view of an imagined McKees Rocks. The landscape is lush and wild, with the famous McKees Rocks Bridge as the only man-made structure in the panorama. Additionally, each window is designed to correspond to the different ethnic groups who call McKees Rocks home: from left to right they are Polish, Carpo-Russian, Ukranian, German, African, Irish, and Native American. The windows themselves are based on Italian Renaissance paintings, representing the Italian community.
Shortly before the mural was commissioned, Focus on Renewal, the community applicant, brought the building on which the mural was painted and turned it into an art center. After the mural was completed, Focus on Renewal went on to adorn all the walls of the building with additional murals. The art center is now a thriving community gathering space and a source of identity and pride to the McKees Rocks community.

Superimposed on this black and white image are the portraits of two of Oakland’s key historical figures: Fred Rogers and Mary Schenley.  
The prominent image of Fred Rogers, better known to the world as Mister Rogers, occupies the center right portion of the mural.  From 1968 to 2001, Mister Rogers broadcast his legendary children’s television program from PBS station WQED located on Fifth Avenue in Oakland, only a short distance from the mural. In 1889, Schenley bequeathed a large portion of her family estate overlooking central Oakland to the City of Pittsburgh; it is known today as Schenley Park.    Finally, a collection of snapshots give us a view of contemporary Oakland and its varied residents and attractions.

The original design only included the side facing Penn Avenue, but when the community group learned that an adjacent building was to be torn down and that the mural would become the new gateway for the community, they raised the funds to extend the mural, covering both sides of the building. In addition to a massive canvas, artist Jordan Monahan, age 19 at the time, was given great freedom in designing the mural. 
With some direction from the community group, Monahan chose a small number of highly spirited images to create a striking and vibrant gateway for East Liberty. The children depicted are from the community, and segments of the old marquee signs from the Enright and Regent theaters can be seen where the two walls come together. Rather than utilizing the traditional dove image, Monahan used pigeons as a symbol of peace because of the plethora of pigeons coasting through the sky over East Liberty. The diversity of the community is expressed through the many colors of the television test pattern running through the mural. By limiting explicit references and letting the images do the work, Monahan created a graphic landmark for East Liberty, incorporating the attitude and identity of this neighborhood into an engaging piece of public art.

The painting of this mural was part of a larger community effort to transform a vacant lot into a beautiful and functional gathering space with a garden, playground equipment, trees, art, and benches. Community members, Home Depot, Kaboom (a national nonprofit dedicated to playground construction) and the Sprout Fund created this park in just one day!

At the time the sculpture was made, the popular bar Gooski’s—located across the street from the wall—was the only attraction for Polish Hill visitors.

Knowing the organization’s ability to mobilize the community, get a large number of people invested in a project, and participate in the process, Sprout Public Art was excited to see another application from them in 2009. Working with artist Ian Thomas, who had previously painted the 2008 mural in the Strip District, was another second for Sprout in this project. Thomas’s design is based on the abstraction of a lunch pail, a symbol of labor that resonated with Greenfield residents. For Thomas, the image was inspired by an iconic scene described to him by his grandfather: each day when his grandfather arrived home, he would place his large lunch pail on the counter, and the entire family would know that he was there.
The mural is located on the side of Hough’s, a local Greenfield business that has become a popular place to eat, drink, and watch Steelers games in the neighborhood. For both Thomas and Sprout, placing a mural in this community hub was a unique opportunity

Fortunately, he discovered that one critical piece of Swissvale’s history fit this shape perfectly: a train. Famous Pittsburgh entrepreneur George Westinghouse founded railroad equipment supplier Union Switch and Signal Company in Swissvale in the late 19th century. Westinghouse’s company employed many Swissvale residents, and proved to be an important part of the community’s development. While these historic roots provide the background for the iconic engine in the mural, Purcell also used a cartoonish style and bright color palette to transition into Swissvale’s present.

Artist Carolyn Kelly captured these historic elements in her 2009 Sprout Public Art mural, unifying them with a tree. Each painted leaf represents a different aspect of the area’s past, ranging from the Heinz Corporation, by which Troy Hill residents have often been employed, to St. Anthony’s Church, which contains the second largest collection of relics in the world—topped only by the Vatican. An incline that no longer stands in Troy Hill is commemorated, as is Pittsburgh’s famous Penn Brewery, known for its annual German Oktoberfest celebration. Kelly also depicted “Pig Hill,” or Troy Hill’s Rialto St., which was known for pigs being led to slaughter on Washington’s Landing. Kelly’s mural puts a more positive twist on this piece of Troy Hill’s past, showing the pigs instead escaping from the hill. 
In her painting process, Kelly allowed some of the signage that had existed on the wall prior the mural’s installation to remain as a design element that can be seen through the new composition. In this way, history wasn’t taken away but rather became a part of the mural: an idea wholly in tune with its greater theme.

The two Andys depicted here are Andrew Carnegie, a well-known Captain of Industry who made and gave away much of his steel fortune here in Pittsburgh, and native Pittsburgher Andy Warhol, a world famous artist and leader of the pop art movement in the 1960s. Both were incredibly influential men, and their legacies live on in Pittsburgh. Conveying the city’s continuing efforts of revitalization, Mosser and Zeffiro’s mural portrays these two prominent men of Pittsburgh receiving a makeover at the salon. As with many of Sprout’s Public Art murals, this piece brings together Pittsburgh’s past and recasts it as a new vision for the future. Along with the revitalization theme, the mural is filled with hidden symbols and allusions to other Pittsburgh icons. August Wilson was a famous African American Pittsburgh playwright whose play Fences adorns the front cover of the magazine held by Andy Warhol. On the back of the magazine is a woman’s profile, superimposed where the three rivers of Pittsburgh come together, which honors the women of the region. A once dilapidated brick wall above a hot dog shop is now a symbol of pride and renaissance.

Because many of the school’s students bus in from other areas, members of local group Observatory Hill Inc. worried that this distance might prevent them from forming a close attachment to the community. When selected for a Sprout Public Art mural, they wanted to make sure that the design would appeal to these students and give them “a visual sense of pride as they board the buses each day.” The artists—both art educators by profession—chose to feature figures based on actual neighborhood kids, in order to engage them more strongly with the piece. While the young people play and talk on the right side of the mural, a figure representing an important piece of the area’s history stands to the left, depicted in a style resembling an old photograph. This is Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, a naval hero in the War of 1812, who serves as the namesake for the school, its mascot the Commodores, and the area where it is located, Perry Hilltop. It is also interesting to note that this wall, with its many windows, might not seem like an optimal location for a mural, but the exciting design elements included cause the obstructions to disappear into the art. David and Fran have both completed other Sprout murals, including David’s 2006 East Carson Street Treasures in the South Side, and Fran’s 2008 Peace, Hope, and Charity in Marshall-Shadeland.

Our focus is in support of a movement of artists of color and their collaborative partners, to highlight Pittsburgh as a city that fosters diversity and supports artists or, at the least, give a space and flexibility for artists to do their thing. The film will spotlight two primary topics: this emerging movement of creativity and synergy happening among this diverse art scene in Pittsburgh, and the artists and spaces that would otherwise be un-/under-seen. Aesthetically, this film will also vary from the normal documentary narrative. We intend to work each artist, their work, and the spaces they create into animated/edited collages. Turning this film into a form of our work and artistic process.

We find a discord between Pittsburgh’s diversity and diversity in Pittsburgh’s arts community. This impacts not only Pittsburgh’s young creative people and their impression of what they can accomplish, but also the nation’s and world’s view of Pittsburgh as a genuine home of a diverse arts community. For the film, we have selected a pretty inclusive and diverse community of artists to address how artists cross lines geographically, culturally and creatively.

In Pittsburgh, badges will enable young people to take new paths of discovery, explore the city's rich resources, and find out what they can learn, make, do, and ultimately become.

The Sprout Fund invited organizations from the Pittsburgh Kids+Creativity Network, schools, libraries, museums, and other youth-serving organizations offering summer learning experiences to apply to participate in this regional effort. The 20 selected organizations will publish their summer learning experiences through a new online platform; create open digital badges that recognize skills, competencies, knowledge, and positive habits; and, join a cohort of innovative learning organizations from across the United States working at the leading edge during the summer of 2014.
