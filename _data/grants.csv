As a testament to their tight-knit spirit, community members helped in the painting of the mural, lending their expertise to assure the design would be as accurate as possible when transferred to the wall. They also helped in the painting phase by painting solid-colored portions of the mural, with Kristin adding the finishing touches. The result is an extremely detailed and very accurate rendering of Regent Square as seen from above. Even the birds, which add a depth and flourish of color to this intricate design, are accurate: all are indigenous species to Regent Square and the neighboring splendor of Frick Park.

The figures standing along the bottom edge of the mural correspond to the community members that Laurie interviewed, and the design is her rendition of how they described their vision. The windows they look through frame a view of an imagined McKees Rocks. The landscape is lush and wild, with the famous McKees Rocks Bridge as the only man-made structure in the panorama. Additionally, each window is designed to correspond to the different ethnic groups who call McKees Rocks home: from left to right they are Polish, Carpo-Russian, Ukranian, German, African, Irish, and Native American. The windows themselves are based on Italian Renaissance paintings, representing the Italian community.
Shortly before the mural was commissioned, Focus on Renewal, the community applicant, brought the building on which the mural was painted and turned it into an art center. After the mural was completed, Focus on Renewal went on to adorn all the walls of the building with additional murals. The art center is now a thriving community gathering space and a source of identity and pride to the McKees Rocks community.

Muralist Monique Luck states that the mural “reflects the diversity of the community through representation of different ages, races, and genders, as well as the vibrant restoration of the neighborhood and its people.” Along with diversity, members of the Northside community wanted the mural to depict a popular community pastime known as “stooping”— the act of sitting on your stoop and visiting your neighbors as the pass by, which is a fundamental way of communicating and building neighborhood connections.
The painting of this mural was part of a larger community effort to transform a vacant lot into a beautiful and functional gathering space with a garden, playground equipment, trees, art, and benches. Community members, Home Depot, Kaboom (a national nonprofit dedicated to playground construction) and the Sprout Fund created this park in just one day!

Among Garfield residents, he is an inspiration and a hero, and they wished to pay tribute with this mural. Torn over depicting a violent incident in a public space, the artist and community decided to convey the essence of Barlow’s heroics rather than the tragedy itself; in the mural, an every-day hero is stepping out between a child and an on-coming bus.

This area, known as the Penn Main Corridor, has struggled to distinguish itself as a unique community amidst a constant change coming from every direction. The site of the new main branch of UPMC’s Children’s hospital, only minutes from the Strip, and a stone’s throw between Bloomfield and Central Lawrenceville, Penn Main is caught between many distinct neighborhoods. Artist Jackie Kresak’s design of an unfinished quilt seemed perfectly suited to the neighborhood. Inspired by a quilt that her mother started but never had the chance to finish, the mural depicts Kresak’s hands picking up where her mother left off. Aptly symbolizing the Penn Main Corridor being bound together as a community, yet still being a work in progress, Kresak comments that “sewing a quilt is like bringing together the different kinds of people and uniting them into one whole blanket or community. The purple folded b lock with the pin in it represents that it, like a community, is still under construction and changing for the better.” The promise of the mural is that, like quilting, the growth of a community identity can take new directions and form new patterns out of the many pieces of itself.

The original design only included the side facing Penn Avenue, but when the community group learned that an adjacent building was to be torn down and that the mural would become the new gateway for the community, they raised the funds to extend the mural, covering both sides of the building. In addition to a massive canvas, artist Jordan Monahan, age 19 at the time, was given great freedom in designing the mural. 
With some direction from the community group, Monahan chose a small number of highly spirited images to create a striking and vibrant gateway for East Liberty. The children depicted are from the community, and segments of the old marquee signs from the Enright and Regent theaters can be seen where the two walls come together. Rather than utilizing the traditional dove image, Monahan used pigeons as a symbol of peace because of the plethora of pigeons coasting through the sky over East Liberty. The diversity of the community is expressed through the many colors of the television test pattern running through the mural. By limiting explicit references and letting the images do the work, Monahan created a graphic landmark for East Liberty, incorporating the attitude and identity of this neighborhood into an engaging piece of public art.

In 2004, a year before the mural’s advent, flooding devastated downtown Carnegie, PA.  Artist Gregg Valley created Rebirth to illustrate the phoenix and community rising and being “reborn” from the receding flood waters, rather than the ashes from legend.  Community landmarks, including the Carnegie Library and the Ukrainian Orthodox church, literally ride on the wings of the phoenix, rising, as it were, with the sun.  Valley, an illustrator by trade, transferred his signature color-facet style to this, his first large-scale painting.  Imbued with movement and energy, this piece led to Valley’s second collaboration with Sprout in the Uptown community in 2006.

Images from history, like portraits of young and elderly Homewood citizens, symbols such as the tree of life, and the façade of local Westinghouse High School, now adorn this very important local landmark. Called the Meadows Bowling Center, this facility is the current resting place of the first bowling alley open to African Americans in Pittsburgh. Ted Page, of the Homestead Grays baseball team, opened the bowling alley in the city’s Hill District. It then moved to East Liberty before finally coming to Homewood, where it now proudly resides. The citizens of Homewood never forgot this building’s importance, and use it now as much as a community center as a thriving bowling alley. The community group believed the mural to be an important addition to the neighborhood; “as essential as a park or new housing,” agrees Maszle.",James Maszle celebrates the history and pride of Homewood/Brushton in the heart of the neighborhood at 7340 Frankstown Avenue.

Artists Tom Mosser and Sarah Zeffiro collaborated with the downtown community group to come up with a design that conveyed a sense of reinvention and revitalization with regard to the area.  The two Andys depicted here are Andrew Carnegie, a well-known Captain of Industry who made and gave away much of his steel fortune here in Pittsburgh, and native Pittsburgher Andy Warhol, a world famous artist and leader of the pop art movement in the 1960s. Both were incredibly influential men, and their legacies live on in Pittsburgh. Conveying the city’s continuing efforts of revitalization, Mosser and Zeffiro’s mural portrays these two prominent men of Pittsburgh receiving a makeover at the salon. As with many of Sprout’s Public Art murals, this piece brings together Pittsburgh’s past and recasts it as a new vision for the future. Along with the revitalization theme, the mural is filled with hidden symbols and allusions to other Pittsburgh icons. August Wilson was a famous African American Pittsburgh playwright whose play Fences adorns the front cover of the magazine held by Andy Warhol. On the back of the magazine is a woman’s profile, superimposed where the three rivers of Pittsburgh come together, which honors the women of the region.

Artist Monika McAndrew festively combines all of these elements in her Bloomfield mural by depicting a parade from the community’s past to present. The background consists of a true-to-life streetscape, complete with the area’s most iconic piece of architecture, the Bloomfield Bridge. George Washington and his men bring up the rear of the parade, harkening back to the area’s Revolutionary War era roots, when Washington provided its namesake by describing it as a “field of many blooms.” Next to take up the path are pairs of traditionally clothed German and Italian [or Polish?] immigrants, representing the waves of different ethnicities settling in the area. Finally, a present-day grandfather and granddaughter lead the parade and suggest the community’s multi-generational appeal today. The entire scene is framed by the outstretched hands of a romantic couple fit for classic Italian cinema, warmed by the glow of the sunset color palette chosen by McAndrew.

Artist Anthony Purcell was challenged to come up with a design that would fit a very long, low wall for his 2007 mural in the heart of this unique area. Fortunately, he discovered that one critical piece of Swissvale’s history fit this shape perfectly: a train. Famous Pittsburgh entrepreneur George Westinghouse founded railroad equipment supplier Union Switch and Signal Company in Swissvale in the late 19th century. Westinghouse’s company employed many Swissvale residents, and proved to be an important part of the community’s development. While these historic roots provide the background for the iconic engine in the mural, Purcell also used a cartoonish style and bright color palette to transition into Swissvale’s present. The pleasant, rolling hills and houses on the right side of the mural represent the community today, with its abundance of green space and picturesque homes.

These people wanted a mural with stylish sophistication to complement their surroundings, and immediately fell in love with Young’s elegant design.

Because many of the school’s students bus in from other areas, members of local group Observatory Hill Inc. worried that this distance might prevent them from forming a close attachment to the community. When selected for a Sprout Public Art mural, they wanted to make sure that the design would appeal to these students and give them “a visual sense of pride as they board the buses each day.” The artists—both art educators by profession—chose to feature figures based on actual neighborhood kids, in order to engage them more strongly with the piece. While the young people play and talk on the right side of the mural, a figure representing an important piece of the area’s history stands to the left, depicted in a style resembling an old photograph. This is Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, a naval hero in the War of 1812, who serves as the namesake for the school, its mascot the Commodores, and the area where it is located, Perry Hilltop. It is also interesting to note that this wall, with its many windows, might not seem like an optimal location for a mural, but the exciting design elements included cause the obstructions to disappear into the art. David and Fran have both completed other Sprout murals, including David’s 2006 East Carson Street Treasures in the South Side, and Fran’s 2008 Peace, Hope, and Charity in Marshall-Shadeland.

She also snuck in a few Pittsburgh references, like a dinosaur and a Steelers scarf, to localize the image. The mural reflects the style of Kelly’s personal illustration work, but achieving this required some inventiveness on her part. She wasn’t able to get the precise stroke that she wanted from a normal paintbrush, and decided to dip an ear of corn from the farmer’s market into her bucket of paint to create a more graceful line! Kelly’s striking color choices and signature illustrative style can also be seen in her 2009 Sprout mural in Troy Hill.","Carolyn Kelly references the South Side farmer's market with a site-specific mural at 1812 East Carson Street, where the weekly market takes place.

Due to its location on West Liberty Avenue, a highly trafficked artery into the City of Pittsburgh, the wall was a highly visible canvas. For Sprout, a combination of a highly visible wall and a community’s excitement to embrace their history made the selection of the wall in Dormont a logical choice. In the mural’s design, the story of the Dormont community is told through a song sung by Slim Bryant, a famous country western singer from the early days of radio who was a native of the area. The people in the mural represent the people of Dormont today, as they go about everyday activities and enjoy the outdoors. Although Sprout rarely allows communities to display their name in murals, not wanting the pieces to be seen as welcome signage, Shields came up with a sly workaround.

It was the Morningside Area Community Council’s best hope that a mural would help draw attention to their restaurant, coffee shop, and other various other businesses. Because the mural wall is located in close proximity to a park where children in the neighborhood frequently play baseball, the community knew that they wanted the mural to be fun, and something that young people would be entertained by.

Working with artist Ian Thomas, who had previously painted the 2008 mural in the Strip District, was another second for Sprout in this project. Thomas’s design is based on the abstraction of a lunch pail, a symbol of labor that resonated with Greenfield residents. For Thomas, the image was inspired by an iconic scene described to him by his grandfather: each day when his grandfather arrived home, he would place his large lunch pail on the counter, and the entire family would know that he was there.
The mural is located on the side of Hough’s, a local Greenfield business that has become a popular place to eat, drink, and watch Steelers games in the neighborhood. For both Thomas and Sprout, placing a mural in this community hub was a unique opportunity

Artist John Pena’s design concept for this project invites the viewer into the composition—his hope being that people will stand in front of their mural to have their portraits taken. The thought balloons in the mural will become the thoughts of the person posing for the portrait, and as these balloons gradually turn into clouds, the mural merges with the actual sky behind it. Through this process, the person’s ideas can become a part of the sky itself.

Artist Carolyn Kelly captured these historic elements in her 2009 Sprout Public Art mural, unifying them with a tree. Each painted leaf represents a different aspect of the area’s past, ranging from the Heinz Corporation, by which Troy Hill residents have often been employed, to St. Anthony’s Church, which contains the second largest collection of relics in the world—topped only by the Vatican. An incline that no longer stands in Troy Hill is commemorated, as is Pittsburgh’s famous Penn Brewery, known for its annual German Oktoberfest celebration. Kelly also depicted “Pig Hill,” or Troy Hill’s Rialto St., which was known for pigs being led to slaughter on Washington’s Landing. Kelly’s mural puts a more positive twist on this piece of Troy Hill’s past, showing the pigs instead escaping from the hill. 
In her painting process, Kelly allowed some of the signage that had existed on the wall prior the mural’s installation to remain as a design element that can be seen through the new composition. In this way, history wasn’t taken away but rather became a part of the mural: an idea wholly in tune with its greater theme.
