    - "Sprout's community building practice powered our work as a community engagement engine. In addition to providing catalytic funding to promising projects, Sprout also spent more than a decade forging connections between people working in service of critical social causes like education, art, and neighborhood development. Early on in our work, we began to understand the value of actively building communities of creative, industrious, and ambitious innovators. We recognized the importance of connecting grantees with each other, with the broader Pittsburgh community, and with national and international stakeholders."
    - "As a result, Sprout developed its community building practice. Our work was deeply influenced by design thinking and human-centered design, and we designed and led intentional, in-person community outreach activities that created the conditions for collaboration. Our experience suggests that most problems cannot be solved in isolation; instead, we believe that positive change results when people openly work together to achieve shared goals."
    - "Some of our events weren't especially revolutionary. We hosted an awful lot of happy hours and met a ton of people over coffee, and those smaller meetings mattered: they were part of a bigger picture of developing trusting relationships that laid the foundation for future work. Meanwhile, our large-scale events truly showcased our expertise: we hosted events jam-packed with hands-on activities and provocative questions intended to spark thoughtful conversation and foster meaningful collaboration between community stakeholders."
    - "We think our community building efforts were most effective because they weren't one-size-fits-all. Instead, we developed lots of ways to engage community members, and the common thread was our creative approach to bringing people together."

      - "Sprout hosted hundreds of small- and large-scale events, from focus groups to multi-day festivals. We think that the most effective experiences make the most of participantsâ€™ time together. We embrace unexpected collaborations. We value openness, which means sharing ideas, showing your work, and inviting contributions from others. We insist on recruiting diverse participants and we employ high-quality facilitators who help push the work forward. Throughout our seventeen-year history, we used the following strategies to build community in Pittsburgh and beyond."
