  details:
    - "The Sprout Fund provided critical financial support for small-scale and first-time projects and programs in the early stages of development—when just a small amount of investment had the potential to yield big results in the community. The projects created new initiatives, events, and organizations that helped citizens take action on pressing issues and enhance the vitality of the Pittsburgh region."
    - "Sprout offered two categories of catalytic funding support with distinctions based on target audience and focus. Learning Innovation funding programs supported projects that impacted children, youth, and teens through new approaches to teaching and learning. Community Innovation funding programs supported projects that fostered creative approaches to civic engagement and community life at the grassroots."
    - "While the focus of the funding programs varied, Sprout opportunities were all connected by being focused on early support for new ideas. By supporting ideas at their germination, our small investments were an entry point for new projects, taking chances on unusual, unexpected, and unique ideas that were not yet proven."

      - title: "Draft Review"
        description:
          - "By reading applications in advance of the deadline, program staff were able to provide insight and feedback on proposals before they were considered for funding.

        features:
          - name: "Seed Award"
            summary: "With such a longstanding program, it was helpful to communicate common suggestions and recommendations that often came up in the review process during draft review so that the advisory committee could then make more nuanced suggestions once it was time for them to review new applications."
            link: "local://program/seed-award/"

          - name: "Neighbor-to-Neighbor"
            summary: "For a “greenlight” program like Neighbor-to-Neighbor, draft reviews were often used to ensure that all of the required materials and information were included and that the project manager had all the pieces in place to implement the project soon after being funded."

        description:
          - "These breakfast events typically took place on a Saturday morning during the week before the deadline and were used to discuss draft application feedback in person and answer last minute questions from applicants.

          - name: "Hive/Spark"

        description:
          - "Online voting was used to engage the broader community in the decisionmaking process for several programs. To prevent it from turning into a popularity contest, the online voting was used to inform the funding recommendations but was typically paired with input from the staff and a group of community advisors. However, several projects did end of being funded due to the high level of interest shown by the community."
        features:
          - name: "Film & Video"
            summary: "The Film & Video program was the first time that Sprout utilized online public voting in the decisionmaking process. The requirement of a video as part of the application was not only fitting for the program but also made the public review more engaging."

          - name: 100 Days""
            summary: "Similarly, 100 Days had a video component to the application and was a program that lent itself to a broader community review.
