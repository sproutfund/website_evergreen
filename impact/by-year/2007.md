In a community theater setting at the downtown Harris Theatre, native Pittsburghers recount their personal war narratives, telling the stories of how world events shape our city and its people, and how our world is changed, too, by people here at home. Also part of the project, a gallery of photography is on display at the Melwood Screening Room, featuring the work of local photographers reflecting on the war, complementing stories with striking imagery and creating a complete, powerful, emotional experience."

        summary: "Monika McAndrew’s <em>Bridging the Generations of Bloomfield</em> showcases old and new residents of Pittsburgh’s “Little Italy” on the side of an iconic neighborhood drug store."
        more: "In the Bloomfield community—known famously throughout the city as “Pittsburgh’s Little Italy,”—there’s a lot to celebrate: a thriving business district with Italian-themed shops and restaurants, a rich multicultural history, and the “Little Italy Days” street fair that began in 2002 and draws an approximate 20,000 attendees annually. Artist Monika McAndrew festively combines all of these elements in her Bloomfield mural by depicting a parade from the community’s past to present. The background consists of a true-to-life streetscape, complete with the area’s most iconic piece of architecture, the Bloomfield Bridge. George Washington and his men bring up the rear of the parade, harkening back to the area’s Revolutionary War era roots, when Washington provided its namesake by describing it as a “field of many blooms.” Next to take up the path are pairs of traditionally clothed immigrants, representing the waves of different ethnicities settling in the area. Finally, a present-day grandfather and granddaughter lead the parade and suggest the community’s multi-generational appeal today. The entire scene is framed by the outstretched hands of a romantic couple fit for classic Italian cinema, warmed by the glow of the sunset color palette chosen by McAndrew. Whatever brings you to the area next—be it a romantic dinner date, an ethnic festival, or a mid-day errand—make sure to include viewing this mural in your next Bloomfield experience!"

        summary: "Gerry Tonti’s <em>Bloom</em> draws tourists and locals away from the majestic Grandview Overlook and into the heart of the business district in Mt. Washington."
        more: "While its beautiful, scenic view of the city defines Mt. Washington for most Pittsburgh residents, the area also holds local treasures that may come as a surprise to those who don’t live there. Shiloh Street is home to restaurants, shops, and a beautiful city park, but visitors to Mt. Washington rarely tread past the overlook area on Grandview Avenue. Residents of Mt. Washington saw a Sprout mural as an opportunity to not only make a beautiful contribution to their community, but also entice visitors to discover its full potential by venturing onto Shiloh Street. With this intention in mind, artist Gerry Tonti created a design with a focus on the wall’s upper-right-hand corner—the portion of the building that can be seen from Grandview Avenue—to draw viewers further into the community. For the scene itself, community members wanted a visually pleasing design that would reflect the idyllic calm of an evening spent gazing at the city skyline. The mural’s skillfully painted, delicate cherry blossoms and serene blue hues help to create this soothing feeling. Now, Mt. Washington residents and visitors alike can make a leisurely walk past this mural and onto Shiloh Street part of their relaxation routine."

        summary: "Anthony Purcell’s <em>Trainscape: Community and Industry</em> echoes Swissvale’s railroad heritage while showing the contemporary neighborhood in bright, vivid colors."
        more: "Swissvale may be located near popular Pittsburgh attractions like Kennywood Park and the Waterfront shopping district, but beautiful, residential area has an identity all its own, with many local businesses and resources.  Artist Anthony Purcell was challenged to come up with a design that would fit a very long, low wall for his 2007 mural in the heart of this unique area. Fortunately, he discovered that one critical piece of Swissvale’s history fit this shape perfectly: a train. Famous Pittsburgh entrepreneur George Westinghouse founded railroad equipment supplier Union Switch and Signal Company in Swissvale in the late 19th century. Westinghouse’s company employed many Swissvale residents, and proved to be an important part of the community’s development. While these historic roots provide the background for the iconic engine in the mural, Purcell also used a cartoonish style and bright color palette to transition into Swissvale’s present. The pleasant, rolling hills and houses on the right side of the mural represent the community today, with its abundance of green space and picturesque homes. Purcell’s mural, too, has become a distinct part of this striking landscape."
