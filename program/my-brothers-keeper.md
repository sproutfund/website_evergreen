context:
  heading: "Promoting Equity Through Collaboration"
  details:
    - "When the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County embraced President Obama’s call to action for My Brother’s Keeper (MBK), The Sprout Fund quickly supported the regional commitment to create a more equitable community where all residents—especially boys and young men of color—benefit from the growth and improvements made in Pittsburgh."
    - "In 2015, a 16-member committee, with representatives from academia, the clergy, community groups, police, city and county government and local school systems, created the local MBK Playbook for the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. Released in October 2015, it identifying strategies and community partners already working to achieve social and economic equity."
    - "To sustain this momentum and with support from the Heinz Endowments, Sprout engaged Homewood Children’s Village (HCV) to serve as the MBK project manager. HCV was tasked to plan and execute MBK-related meetings, communication, evaluation, and advocacy. Additionally, Sprout engaged Urbankind Institute to lead a community and stakeholder planning process."
    - "These efforts informed the Digital Literacy Collaborative, a community of practice Sprout established to connect organizations who worked directly with youth, particularly young men of color ages 16-24, in out-of-school-time settings, to resource organizations with demonstrated experience in mentorship, youth leadership, and/or digital literacy best practices."
    - "Finally, Sprout supported a comprehensive planning process for the future of MBK. An in-depth action plan was developed as a result of stakeholder feedback and community conversations. The action plan was used to secure ongoing funding for the initiative at a new long-term organizational home."
