  details:
    - "From 2014 to 2016, The Sprout Fund worked with local and national partners to promote digital badges for learning. Like badges earned in scouting, digital badges recognize learning wherever and whenever it happens: in classrooms, in libraries, in city parks, and more."
    - "Sprout led local and national conversations about this new model’s potential to transform how employers and educators recognize and reward learning. It was closely aligned with our stewardship of the Remake Learning Network and its efforts to make remarkable learning opportunities available to all youth in the greater Pittsburgh region."
    - "With City of Learning, our region joined a national movement to develop digital badges for learning to help young people explore their interests, develop new skills, and connect with real-world opportunities. In 2014 and 2015, Pittsburgh was one of the four vanguard cities piloting this approach, and we were one of 12 Cities of Learning nationwide using the LRNG platform in 2016."
    - "Through this program, more than 6,000 students across Pittsburgh and the surrounding communities of Allegheny County had the opportunity to earn more than 8,000 digital badges through their participation in summer programs in schools, museums, libraries, and learning spaces across the city."
    - "To develop this new learning ecosystem, Sprout worked behind the scenes to coordinate the tools, trainings, and support that educators would need to translate their existing learning programs into the language of digital badges. We built major partnerships with regional institutions, hosted large-scale events to focus community attention on this opportunity, and developed tools and resources used in Pittsburgh and across the country."
    - "Along the way, we enlisted the expertise of local community members, documented our work, and shared what we learned."

          - "Sprout supported 45 summer enrichment programs in 2014 and 2015 that provided 6,000 young people the chance to explore their interests, develop new skills, and connect to real-world opportunity. We recruited a cohort of smaller-scale partners who we led through a series of trainings and engagement activities to help them develop badges to reward students who participate in their programs for their achievements."
          - "We also built relationships with 3 major citywide partners: our public school system, our public library system, and the local workforce investment board, which champions our region’s summer youth employment program."
          - "Finally, Sprout hosted several community events each summer to help build awareness of innovative learning activities available to youth and families throughout the city."
