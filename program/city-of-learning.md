  details:
    - "From 2013 to 2017, The Sprout Fund worked with local and national partners to promote digital badges. Like badges earned in scouting, digital badges recognize learning wherever and whenever it happens: in classrooms, in libraries, in city parks, and more. Through summer programs like City of Learning and national events like the Summit to Reconnect Learning, Sprout led local and national conversations about this new model’s potential to transform how employers and educators recognize and reward learning."
