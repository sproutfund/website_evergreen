  details:
    - "To provide an opportunity for Pittsburgh’s community of filmmakers, videographers, and multimedia artists to showcase their approach to community innovation, The Sprout Fund announced a special Request for Proposals in fall 2013 to support film, video, and multimedia art projects. Sprout partnered closely with Pittsburgh Filmmakers/Pittsburgh Center for the Arts to cultivate applicants and support funded projects."
    - "In Fall 2013, Sprout offered a Request for Proposals for Innovative Community Film and Video Projects. For this RFP, Sprout sought $10,000 proposals from Pittsburgh’s filmmakers, videographers, and multimedia artists to catalyze the creation or completion of new and innovative community-based projects that take the form of short or feature-length films, documentaries, online videos, and multimedia experiences."
    - "Winning projects were selected by a seven-person jury that included members of the standing Seed Award for Community Innovation Advisory Committee, representatives of the film and video community, and experts in film and video creation, production, and management. Several of the recognized films went on to further development and cinematic release in the years ahead: for example, “Aspie Seeks Love” won Best Documentary Feature Film at its premier at Cinequest Film Festival, and “Fursonas” won a “Spirit of Slamdance” award at its premier at Slamdance Film Festival."

# In November 2013, The Sprout Fund requested proposals to catalyze the creation or completion of new and innovative community-based projects that take the form of short or feature-length films, documentaries, online videos, and multimedia experiences.

# Through this special opportunity, Sprout is enabling Pittsburgh’s community of filmmakers, videographers, and multimedia artists to showcase their approach to community innovation and receive support for their work.

# Each applicant submitted a unique Competition Short to represent their project. Between November 25th and December 2nd, the public had a chance to view the shorts and “like” those they wanted to see move forward. The online voting process generated more than 8,000 likes.

# Following the public voting period, jurors and community volunteers representing Pittsburgh’s film and video community engaged in an extensive review process that considered likes as indicators of community support and used additional criteria to decide which projects would receive awards.

# The Sprout Fund has selected Aspie Seeks Love, Fursonas, and Give Us A Chance–Pittsburgh Punk to receive the full $10,000 grants accompanied by technical support from Pittsburgh Filmmakers. 6 other film & video projects also received $1,000 Honorable Mention awards.

# On behalf of our partner, Pittsburgh Filmmakers, and supporters, The Pittsburgh Foundation, The Hillman Foundation, and the Fisher Fund of The Pittsburgh Foundation, all of us at Sprout appreciate the Pittsburgh filmmaking community’s participation in this process and wish the best of luck to all applicants in their future endeavors.
