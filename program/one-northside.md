  details:
    - "One Northside was a community-driven initiative to improve the quality of life in all 18 neighborhoods of Pittsburgh’s Northside. Beginning in early 2014, hundreds of Northside residents engaged with local leaders and stakeholders in community-wide conversations to create a shared agenda for the revitalization of this vital component of the greater Pittsburgh region. "
    - "Facilitated by Jackson/Clark Partners and supported by the Buhl Foundation, this process leveraged existing community assets and the dedication of the people of the Northside to create a meaningful community driven engagement initiative and articulate a compelling vision for the future of these communities."

    description:
      - "The Sprout Fund provided catalytic support to advance the One Northside vision through the Neighbor-to-Neighbor micro grant stream from 2015-2017. These resident-led projects raised awareness about Northside organizations, events, and activities; engaged Northside residents to take an active role in the civic life of their community; and provided opportunities for motivated community members to assume leadership roles in the ongoing transformation of the Northside."
      - "Sprout’s combination of direct funding and ongoing support helped to increase the capacity of diverse groups of Northsiders and tapped into the ingenuity of these emerging leaders to create innovative responses to the issues and challenges faced by Northside neighborhoods and communities."
