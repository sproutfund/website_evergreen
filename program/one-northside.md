  details:
    - "One Northside is a community-driven initiative to improve the quality of life in all 18 neighborhoods of Pittsburgh’s Northside. Beginning in early 2014, hundreds of Northside residents engaged with local leaders and stakeholders in community-wide conversations to create a shared agenda for the revitalization of this vital component of the greater Pittsburgh region."
    - "Facilitated by Jackson/Clark Partners and supported by the Buhl Foundation, this process leveraged existing community assets and the dedication of the people of the Northside to create a meaningful community driven engagement initiative and articulate a compelling vision for the future of these communities."
    - "In 2015, through support from The Buhl Foundation, The Sprout Fund began to catalyze innovative community projects and create continued opportunities for Northsiders to more easily contribute to the One Northside vision."

  - title: "Our Approach"
    description:
      - "The Sprout Fund provided catalytic support to advance the One Northside vision through the Neighbor-to-Neighbor micro grant stream in 2015-2017. Sprout’s combination of direct funding and ongoing support helped to increase the capacity of diverse groups of Northsiders and tapped into the ingenuity of these emerging leaders to create innovative responses to the issues and challenges faced by Northside neighborhoods and communities."
      - "In total, 142 projects were supported through the Neighbor-to-Neighbor micro grant stream. These projects raised awareness about Northside organizations, events, and activities; engaged Northside residents to take an active role in the civic life of their community; and provided opportunities for motivated community members to assume leadership roles in the ongoing transformation of the Northside."
      - "Applicants that lived or worked on the Northside, had a project that contributed to the One Northside vision, and were able to demonstrate community support for their project through petition signatures, letters of support, and small financial pledges from the local community were approved to receive funding through a “green light” process. Info sessions and direct outreach on the Northside were used to communicate these program requirements and support prospective applicants as they completed their applications."
      - "Throughout the program, community events were used to solicit in-kind support from neighbors, update the community on project activities, and celebrate the great work happening throughout the Northside. These events were always free, open to the public, and outside of regular business hours to help encourage a high turnout of local community members."
