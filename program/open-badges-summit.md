  details:
    - "The 2014 Open Badges Summit to Reconnect Learning brought together nearly 300 participants from around the world to work together on setting the course for the next evolution of Open Badges, a new approach to assessing learning and recognizing skills and competencies wherever they are learned—in school, on the job, in the community, or online."
    - "Since emerging through a series of pilot projects like the Chicago Summer of Learning and supported by research initiatives like HASTAC, Open Badges have demonstrated the potential for disruptive innovation in the way we learn in today’s connected, digital world. Held in February 2014 in Silicon Valley, the Summit to Reconnect Learning was the first event to focus on moving Open Badges from the edges of innovation to the mainstream."
    - "For K-12 schools, out-of-school programs, colleges and universities, as well as businesses and professional organizations, open digital badges are an increasingly popular way to verify and document skills and achievements that are not adequately measured by standardized tests and traditional resumes or diplomas. Throughout the event, a wave of new business and education partners made public pledges committing to help accelerate the spread and scale of digital badges for learning."
    - "The Sprout Fund hosted the event on behalf of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, a leader in the Open Badges movement."

    description:
      - "Working groups were a critical component of the Summit to Reconnect Learning. Composed of a diverse array of participants, 21 groups were assembled to represent a variety of badge audiences, various levels of awareness and experience with badging, and different potential roles within Open Badges (issuers, earners, endorsers, researchers, badge system designers, etc.)."
      - "Discussions were facilitated by Sprout Fund-trained moderators who led Working Groups through a process designed to help participants at all levels of the badge awareness spectrum discuss issues related to the conception and implementation of badge projects. One of the ultimate goals of the Working Group process was to enable participants to develop pledges that would commit their organizations to the shared effort to move the Open Badges movement forward."
