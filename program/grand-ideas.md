  details:
    - "Grand Ideas were those thoughts that kept people up at night. The ones that could become something amazing, but needed a little support to get started. The Sprout Fund thought those ideas were worth something, so we asked the community “What’s your Grand Idea? How would you use $1,000 for an innovative community project?”"
    - "The $1,000 grants were smaller versions of Seed Awards, supporting individuals and organizations in the Pittsburgh area with innovative approaches to community projects and civic engagement. This micro grant support promoted innovation at the grassroots, taking chances on people and ideas that were most relevant at that point in time. The projects were very fast moving, requiring the activities to be implemented within approximately a year of receiving the grant support. The quick decisionmaking and funding disbursement process helped to set Sprout’s funding apart from the more strategic, long-term support of more traditional funders and often helped project leaders pilot or test out an idea before bringing it to scale."
    - "While the first round of what would later become known as “Grand Ideas” took place at the end of 2012 as the conclusion of the year-long Social Innovation Exchange, the approach was at play since Sprout’s early years, with aspects of the $1,000 innovation grant concept seen through several other programs in the Sprout funding portfolio. Despite the small amount of funding, many of these projects were staff favorites that truly left an impact on the communities they served due to their memorable approaches to addressing everyday issues."

      - "Grand Ideas came in all shapes in forms.

      - title: "Art as Civic Action"
        description:
          - "Art was often used to highlight issues in a way that was appealing and accessible to the broader community. This not only supported artists to get actively involved in their communities but also promoted art as something that could, and should, be an important part of every community."
