  details:
    - "Community Connections was a regional grantmaking program led by The Sprout Fund on the occasion of the Pittsburgh region’s 250th anniversary. In partnership with the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, and dozens of other partners, Community Connections granted nearly $1 million to 100 projects across 14 counties of Southwestern Pennsylvania."
    - "Community Connections engaged citizens, addressed pressing issues, left a lasting impact on communities, and contributed to the “Pride & Progress” of Southwestern Pennsylvania in 2008. Led by established and emerging civic leaders, these initiatives created a critical mass of grassroots activity throughout the anniversary year."
    - "Community Connections was divided into four phases: Idea Generation & Solicitation, Project Selection, Project Execution, and Reporting & Documentation."
    - "In summer 2007, Sprout invited neighborhoods, communities, and civic organizationsin Southwestern Pennsylvania to “Imagine What You Can Do Here.” A coordinated outreach campaign was conducted to garner ideas from across the 14-county region and encourage the submission of applications from as diverse a network as possible. Ultimately, in fall 2017, 558 applications were received for consideration."
    - "Sprout used a community-based decisionmaking model to select 100 projects to receive support. 270 people participated as part of 15 decisionmaking teams, one for each of the 14 counties and one regional committee. All meetings were held in person and used the scoring and selection process that was originally developed for the Seed Award program."
    - "Throughout 2008, in addition to grant dollars, Sprout provided each project with technical assistance, marketing support, and fostered collaboration between related projects. A significant effort was made to professionally document and capture the persons, projects, and activities that had a role in making the Community Connections a success, resulting in 2009 in the creation of <em>Making the Connections</em>, a collection of stories about the funded projects and their impact on their communities."
    - "The program marked the first time that Sprout’s footprint expanded beyond Pittsburgh and proved that Sprout’s community decisionmaking model was effective in geographically diverse environments. Community Connections also represented Sprout’s first deep dive into program documentation, which resulted in an increased focus on professional photography and writing for many future funding programs."
