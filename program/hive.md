  details:
    - "In 2013, Pittsburgh joined Hive Learning Networks, an international movement to reimagine learning across youth-serving organizations. Every day, students move among learning experiences in formal classrooms and in a range of informal settings, from museums and libraries to afterschool programs and community centers."
    - "Hive Learning Networks endeavor to link these environments to create “connected learning” experiences where youth can participate in accessible, “anytime, anywhere” learning activities by pursuing their interests and engaging with their peers."
    - "With support from the MacArthur Foundation’s digital media and learning initiative, the first Hive Learning Networks were created in New York City in 2007 and Chicago in 2009. Pittsburgh’s Hive operated within the Remake Learning Network as an ongoing grant program to spur new connected learning projects and programs for tweens, teens, and young adults."
    - "Although Hive ceased to be a brand actively used in Pittsburgh at the end of 2015, Sprout continued to support Connected Learning with catalytic funding and event sponsorships through the Remake Learning funding stream starting in 2016."

    description:
      - "In 2017, Sprout helped 10 Remake Learning Network organizations develop new lesson plans inspired by their previously supported Connected Learning programs. This collection of resources was designed to share, remix, and reuse, and it exemplifies some of the best connected learning practices that have developed in Pittsburgh."
      - "The projects come from remarkably varied sources, including public schools, libraries, museums, and makerspaces. Each project is deeply interdisciplinary: major themes include ecology, sustainability, and visual arts, but these lessons delve into intersections between art, technology, science, history, and more. Some of these lesson plans are for activities lasting an hour or a few class periods; others are intended as major projects that can unfold over several weeks or an entire school year."
      - "Use these PDF downloads as starting points to adapt, remix, and reframe connected learning practices in your own classroom or learning space. All have Creative Commons licenses to help share and spread the remarkable learning practices happening here in the Pittsburgh region with educators everywhere!"
